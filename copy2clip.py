#Copying the contents of a text file to the clipboard is an all-too-frequent task, whether it’s a log file someone wants to see, a configuration file you need to share, or even an ssh key. 
#Getting to the file is easy enough on the command line, but then having to open it in an editor just to copy-and-paste takes time you don’t need to waste.
#The following copy2clip script works on both Windows and Mac, and uses native functionality that is wrapped in a little bit of Python code to load the files into the clipboard.

import sys
import platform
import subprocess

# Seeing if the file exists
if os.path.exists(sys.argv[1]):
    f = open(sys.argv[1], "r")
    f_contents = f.read()
    f.close()
else:
    print("Usage: copy2clip <file_name>")
    exit(1)
